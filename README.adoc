= SmallRye GraphQL Federation Demo

This is a little demo project to show the GraphQL Federation backend support in https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql[SmallRye GraphQL], which is currently being developed.

== Parts

* `product` GraphQL backend `war`: serves the name and the description.
* `price` GraphQL backend `war`: extends the product by a price.
* `order` GraphQL backend `war`: uses products for the order items.
* `gateway` GraphQL Federation server: combines the three backends into One API.
* `printer` Quarkus GraphQL CLI client: calls the gateway to print an order with all details.


The `war` files currently include the SmallRye GraphQL libraries in version 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT. You can deploy them to an Jakarta EE 9.0 server, e.g. https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/[WildFly 27] (currently 27.0.0.Alpha4).

Start the `gateway` with `yarn install` and `yarn start`.

Finally run `mvn verify` in the `printer` module.
